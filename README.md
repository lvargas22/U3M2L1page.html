<P>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (10 December 1815 â€“ 27 November 1852), born Augusta Ada Byron and now commonly known as Ada Lovelace, was an English.</p>
<page-break>
<p>mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the </p>
<page-break>
<p>engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. Because of this, she is often described as the world's first</p>
<page-break>
<p>computer programmer.</p>

<p>Lovelace was born 10 December 1815 as the only child of the poet Lord Byron and his wife Anne Isabella Byron. All Byron's other children were born out </p>
<page-break>
<p>of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever four months later, eventually dying of disease</p>
<p>page-break</p>
<p>in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old. Ada's mother remained bitter towards Lord Byron and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics</p>
<page-break>
<p>and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing what she saw as the insanity seen in her father, but Ada remained interested in him despite this.</p>
<page-break>
<p>(and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at her request).</p>
